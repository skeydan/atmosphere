In an Eulerian framework, the total (also called: material) derivative of a quantity that in the Lagrangian framework, varies w.r.t. time only, has 2 parts: a local derivative and an advection term:

$$
\frac{D \rho}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y} v +  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z} w
$$

## Continuity equation (conservation of mass)

Conservation of mass, in an Eulerian framework, means that no mass is gained or lost:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

where

$$
\nabla \cdot(\rho \mathbf{u}) = \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x}  + \frac{\partial (\rho v)}{\partial y}  +  \frac{\partial (\rho w)}{\partial z} 
$$

is the divergence of $\rho \mathbf{u}$.

Applying the product rule of derivatives, this means that

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y} v +  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z} w + \rho(\frac{\partial u} {\partial x} + \frac{\partial v} {\partial y} + \frac{\partial w} {\partial z}) = 0
$$

The change in mass may be split into two parts, the material derivative and density times the divergence of velocity:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(\rho \mathbf{u}) \
= [\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + ( \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)  \rho] + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$
