## Incoming solar radiation

The incoming solar radiation *per unit area* is:

$$
S_{in} = S \frac{\pi R^2}{4 \pi R^2} = S/4 = 342 \  W/m^2
$$

where

$S$ is the solar constant, $1.386 \ W/m^2$

$\pi R^2$ is the area of a disk of earth radius R, representing the "half" of the earth receiving sunlight, and

$4 \pi R^2$ is the surface area of the earth (we divide by that to get irradiance per unit area)
