## Vorticity

Rotation is the cross product between a velocity field $v$ and the gradient vector:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix}i&j&k\\\frac{\partial}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial}{\partial y}&\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\\u&v&w\end{vmatrix}
$$

Vorticity is the vertical component of rotation:

$$
\zeta = \mathbf{k} \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf{v}
$$
