## Specific heat capacity

Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy needed to warm a mass of 1 kg by 1K.

When the volume stays constant, this is $c_v$, *specific heat at constant volume*. Here pressure must increase.

When pressure stays constant, this is $c_p$, *specific heat at constant pressure*. Here the volume increases.

Relevant constants are:

##### Poisson constant

$$
\kappa = \frac{R}{c_p} = \frac{c_p - c_v}{c_p}
$$

##### $\eta$

$$
\eta = \frac{c_p}{c_v}
$$

## Potential temperature

Potential temperature $\theta$ is the temperature of a particle brought to 1000hPa by an adiabatic process.

$$
\theta = T {(\frac{1000hPa}{p})}^\kappa
$$

or

$$
\frac{theta}{T}\ =  {(\frac{1000hPa}{p})}^\kappa
$$

## Virtual temperature

Virtual temperature is the temperature a parcel would have, at the same pressure and with the same volume, if the air was dry:

$$
T_v = T + \Delta T = T + 0.608q T
$$

where $q$ is specific humidity.
