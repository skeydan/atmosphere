## Incoming solar radiation

The incoming solar radiation *per unit area* is:

$$
S_{in} = S \frac{\pi R^2}{4 \pi R^2} = S/4 = 342 \  W/m^2
$$

where

$S$ is the solar constant, $1.386 \ W/m^2$

$\pi R^2$ is the area of a disk of earth radius R, representing the "half" of the earth receiving sunlight, and

$4 \pi R^2$ is the surface area of the earth (we divide by that to get irradiance per unit area)

Thereof, the absorbed power is the non-reflected part:

$$
E_{in} = (1 - \alpha) S/4
$$

## Earth outgoing longwave radiation

By the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the outgoing radiation is

$$
E_{out} = \epsilon \sigma T^4
$$

with

$\epsilon$ the emissivity and

$\sigma$ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

## Energy balance

$$
\epsilon \sigma T^4 = (1 - \alpha) S/4
$$

This would yield a temperature of 255K, about 33 degrees too low.
