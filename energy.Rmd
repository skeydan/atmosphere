## Enthalpy

Enthalpy is internal energy plus potential energy (work done on the system):

$$
H = U + pV
$$

The change in internal energy $\Delta u$ is

$$
\Delta u = u_2 - u_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_v(T) dT
$$

where $c_v$ is specific heat capacity at *constant volume*. Put differently,

$$
U = m c_v T
$$

The change in enthalpy $\Delta h$ is

$$
\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p(T) dT
$$

where $c_p$ is specific heat capacity at *constant pressure*. Put differently,

$$
H = m c_p T
$$

The constant pressure process is more efficient at heat absorption, so

$$
c_p \ge c_v
$$

The difference between both is the specific gas constant:

$$
R = c_p - c_v
$$

The differential of enthalpy subsumes changes in internal energy as well as work done on a system:

$$
dH = dU + pdV + Vdp
$$

or

$$
dH = dQ + Vdp
$$
