## Internal energy

The change in internal energy $\Delta u$ is

$$
\Delta u = u_2 - u_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_v(T) dT
$$

where $c_v$ is specific heat capacity at *constant volume*.

Put differently, the internal energy $U$ is

$$
U = m c_v T
$$

## Enthalpy

Enthalpy is internal energy plus potential energy (work done on the system):

$$
H = U + pV
$$

The change in enthalpy $\Delta h$ is

$$
\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} c_p(T) dT
$$

where $c_p$ is specific heat capacity at *constant pressure*. Put differently,

$$
H = m c_p T
$$

The constant pressure process is more efficient at heat absorption, so

$$
c_p \ge c_v
$$

The difference between both is the specific gas constant:

$$
R = c_p - c_v
$$

The differential of enthalpy subsumes changes in internal energy as well as work done on a system:

$$
dH = dU + pdV + Vdp
$$

or

$$
dH = dQ + Vdp
$$

## Potential energy

The change in potential energy is

$$
dE_p = g \ z \ dm = g\ z\ \rho\ dV = g\ z\ \rho\ F\ dz
$$

## Relationship of potential and internal energy

$$
E_p = \frac{R}{c_v} \ E_i
$$

## Total potential energy

Together, potential and internal energy make up the total potential energy. That is the same as *enthalpy*:

$$
E_{total} = E_p + U = \eta U = H
$$

where $\eta = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$
